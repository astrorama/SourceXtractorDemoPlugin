 *  This class handles the configuration of the Petrosian tasks. If you have

 *  separated configurations too.
 *
 *  The configuration procedure has three steps: pre-initialization, initialization and post-initialization.
 *  We only implement the initialization step here. For more details, look at the documentation of
 *  Euclid::Configuration::Configuration
